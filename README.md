# Task-Management-System
I built this task management system with task monitoring and clock-in/clock-out functionality using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 
The system provides a user-friendly interface for managing tasks and tracking time. Key features include:
    Task Management:
        Users can create, edit, and delete tasks, each with a unique identifier and details.
        Tasks are organized in a clear and structured manner for easy navigation.
    Clock-In/Clock-Out:
        Users can log their work hours by clocking in and out for each task.
        The system records the start and end times of each work session, associating them with the corresponding task.
    User Authentication:
        A secure login system ensures that only authorized users can access and interact with the task management features.
    Responsive Design:
        The interface is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices for a seamless user experience.
    Real-time Updates:
        The system provides real-time updates, allowing users to see the elapsed time for each task as they work.
    Task Status Tracking:
        Users can mark tasks as "in progress," "completed," or "pending," providing a quick overview of task statuses.
    Reporting and Analytics:
        The system generates reports on individual and team productivity, displaying summarized data on tasks completed and time spent.
